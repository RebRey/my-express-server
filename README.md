# my-express-server
Create a local server with express.js

STEP 1: Create a document called server.js

STEP 2: Initialize npm with server.js as a start point.
* in the terminal cd into the current project directory (my-express-server)
* initialize npm by typing "npm init" and follow the terminal prompts. 
* this will create the package.json document in the my-express-server project

STEP 3: Install express and save it in the dependencies list in the package.json document. Type this into the terminal $ npm install express.
This will create a package-lock.json document and node_modules folder that express requires in your project directory.

STEP 4: On the server.js document require express. Follow the hello world example from expressjs.com. (https://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html)
